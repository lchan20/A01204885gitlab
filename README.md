# .md vs .txt vs .html
.md stands for Markdown
Github uses it instead of plain text because this markdown language can be both plain text and easily converted into HTML
in other words its a text-to-HTML conversion tool 
in certain environments, the readme.md file can display certain styling elements
"Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax" - wikipedia
.md is preferred over .html because it can be read without converting it to html
so .md is better than both .txt because its prettier and .html because it is more convenient
